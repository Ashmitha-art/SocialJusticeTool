        •        Apply regression techniques to real-world data
        •        Understand the relationship between variables using nonparametric measures


Teaching Methods


        •        Lectures: In-person or via Zoom as needed
        •        Assignments: Weekly tasks to apply and reinforce concepts
        •        Exams: Three exams to assess conceptual knowledge and analytical skills














Student Learning Outcomes


By the end of the course, students will be able to:


        •        Apply statistical methods in research contexts
        •        Analyze data using correlation and regression techniques
        •        Communicate statistical findings to diverse audiences


Grading


Your grade will be based on:


        •        Assignments (40%): Designed to test technical knowledge and analysis skills.
        •        Graded on a 10-point scale:
        •        10 points: Accurate answer with full work shown
        •        8 points: Partially correct with substantial effort
        •        5 points: Incorrect answer with substantial effort
        •        0 points: No submission or inadequate effort
        •        Exams (60%): Three exams, one of which will be oral.


Grade Scale:


        •        A: 94%-100%
        •        A-: 90%-93%
        •        B+: 84%-89%
        •        B-: 80%-83%
        •        C: 70%-79%
        •        F: 0%-69.9%
