particular economic issue or event. They will also develop an understanding of the role played by 
economic institutions, as well as how public policy can affect economic and social outcomes. #2: In the 
program, students will master the ability to collect, process, interpret, analyze and draw conclusions from 
economic information and economic data using appropriate quantitative methods. #3: Students will 
develop and expand on skills necessary to effectively communicate economic ideas both orally and in 
writing to a wide audience.  ",0.9393,0.139,0.861,0.0

Review 
Objectives: Review mathematical concepts that will be necessary for this class and some basic 
Economics concepts.  
Before jumping into the course content, I recommend a review on exponents, derivatives and partial 
derivatives (using the Khan academy videos or Achieve reviews) and complete the math review 
assignment. GLS’s Math Review Appendix is helpful for a quick refresh of concepts. Review GLS 
Chapter 2 on your own to refresh on basic principles of economics. ",0.6486,0.073,0.927,0.0

37,"Academic Integrity 
PLEASE DO NOT CHEAT. You will be less than adequately prepared for the rest of the major 
classes if you do not do the work yourself and make a serious attempt to learn the material.  
Cheating is the actual or attempted practice of fraudulent or deceptive acts for the purpose of improving 
one’s grade or obtaining course credit; such acts also include assisting another student to do so. Typically, 
such acts occur in relation to examinations. However, it is the intent of this definition that the term 
‘cheating’ not be limited to examination situations only, but that it include any and all actions by a student 
that are intended to gain an un-earned academic advantage by fraudulent or deceptive means. Plagiarism 
is a specific form of cheating which consists of the misuse of the published and/or unpublished works of 
others by misrepresenting the material (i.e., their intellectual property) so used as one’s own work. 
Penalties for cheating and plagiarism range from 0 or F on a particular assignment, through an F for the 
course, to expulsion from the university. For more information on the University’s policy regarding 
cheating and plagiarism, refer to the University Catalog (‘Policies and Regulations’).  
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accommodations: The University is committed to providing 
reasonable academic accommodations to students with disabilities. The Disability Programs and 
Resources Center provides university academic support services and specialized assistance to students 
with disabilities. Individuals with physical, perceptual, or learning disabilities as addressed by the 
Americans with Disabilities Act should contact Services for Students with Disabilities for information 
regarding accommodations. Please notify your instructor so that reasonable effort can be made to 
accommodate you. If you expect Accommodation through the Act, you must make a formal request through 
Disability Programs & Resources Center in SSB 110, Telephone 338-2472.  
Student disclosures of sexual violence 
SF State fosters a campus free of sexual violence including sexual harassment, domestic violence, dating 
violence, stalking, and/or any form of sex or gender discrimination. If you disclose a personal experience 
as an SF State student, the course instructor is required to notify the Title IX Coordinator by completing 
the report form available at http://titleix.sfsu.edu, emailing vpsaem@sfsu.edu or calling 338-2032. ",-0.9738,0.089,0.787,0.124
